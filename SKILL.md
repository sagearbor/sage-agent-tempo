# sage-agent-tempo

This skill creates an audit trail of your AI agent development work.

## When to activate

Only follow these instructions when:
- The user mentions "sage-agent-tempo", "tempo", or "track this build"
- A `developer_checklist.yaml` already exists in the project root
- The project's CLAUDE.md references sage-agent-tempo

If none of these apply, ignore this skill entirely — do not create checklists or announce items unprompted.

## For agents working on a project with this skill

### Zero-setup: generating a checklist from spec

If the project has no `developer_checklist.yaml`, create one **immediately** — before doing any other work. This ensures all tokens are tracked from the very first turn.

1. **Look for any planning context**: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `PRP.md`, `PRD.md`, `SPEC.md`, or any document describing what needs to be built.

2. **Create a stub checklist right away**, even if the full scope is unknown. Include at least one item for the current work. For projects where the first task is research/discovery:

```yaml
project: project-name
phases:
  - id: discovery
    name: Discovery & Planning
    items:
      - id: "1.1"
        title: Research and document existing system
        tags: [docs]
        acceptance: |
          - Discovery documents written
          - Full developer_checklist.yaml generated from findings

  - id: placeholder
    name: Implementation (to be expanded)
    items:
      - id: "2.1"
        title: TBD — will be detailed after discovery
        tags: [backend]
```

3. **Say "Starting item 1.1"** before beginning discovery/research work. This captures those tokens under the discovery phase instead of losing them to overhead.

4. **Expand the checklist as you learn more.** After discovery, replace the placeholder phase with detailed items based on what you found. The checklist is a living document — update it throughout development.

5. **Commit the checklist** so other agents (and future sessions) can use it.

### During development

**CRITICAL — ALL agents (main and subagents) MUST do this:**

1. **Before starting work**, read `developer_checklist.yaml` to understand the plan.
2. **When you start an item**: say "Starting item X.Y" in your first response. This is how tokens get attributed to checklist items.
3. **When you finish an item**: say "Completed item X.Y" in your response.
4. **If you are spawning subagents**: include the checklist item ID in the subagent's prompt. Example: "You are working on item 2.3. Say 'Starting item 2.3' at the beginning of your response."
5. **If you are a subagent**: say "Starting item X.Y" at the top of your first response AND include a TEMPO_STATUS block at the end (see format below). Do NOT modify `developer_checklist.yaml` directly.
6. **When scope changes** (main agent only): update `developer_checklist.yaml` — add new items, update titles, mark status.

### After work

Reports are generated via CLI:

```bash
npx sage-agent-tempo parse --agent claude-code
npx sage-agent-tempo report --format all
```

After generating reports, render `reports/*.excalidraw` files to PNG if possible.

### Where data lives

- **Checklist**: `developer_checklist.yaml` in the project root
- **Build log**: `build_log.json` (generated, gitignored)
- **Reports**: `reports/` directory (generated, gitignored)

### Supported tags

Use these tags in `developer_checklist.yaml` items for architecture breakdown:
`backend`, `frontend`, `mcp`, `tools`, `tests`, `config`, `docs`, `data`

### Keeping the checklist small

When many items are complete, collapse them to save agent context:

```bash
npx sage-agent-tempo collapse
```

This strips acceptance/notes/priority from done items, keeping only id, title, tags, and `status: done`.

### TEMPO_STATUS format (for subagents)

If you are a subagent, do NOT modify `developer_checklist.yaml` directly. Instead, include this block at the end of your response:

```
TEMPO_STATUS:
- completed: "2.1"
- completed: "2.2"
- in_progress: "2.3"
- discovered: { title: "Handle edge case X", phase: "core", tags: [backend] }
```

The orchestrator or a dedicated sync agent will update the YAML from these reports. This avoids parallel write conflicts and keeps your context focused on your actual work.

### Sync agent pattern

When an orchestrator spawns subagents, it should also spawn a lightweight "tempo-sync" agent whose only job is to watch for `TEMPO_STATUS` blocks in subagent outputs and update `developer_checklist.yaml` accordingly.

**Why a dedicated sync agent?** Subagents should never write to `developer_checklist.yaml` directly — parallel writes cause conflicts and data loss. Instead, all subagents emit `TEMPO_STATUS` blocks, and the sync agent is the single writer that applies those updates.

**How it works:**

1. The orchestrator spawns subagents for actual work (e.g., "build feature X", "write tests for Y").
2. The orchestrator also spawns one `tempo-sync` agent.
3. When a subagent finishes and its output contains a `TEMPO_STATUS` block, the orchestrator routes that block to the sync agent.
4. The sync agent reads `developer_checklist.yaml`, applies the updates, and writes it back.

**Sample prompt for the sync agent:**

```
You are the sage-agent-tempo sync agent. Your only job is to update developer_checklist.yaml based on TEMPO_STATUS blocks from other agents. When you receive a status update: mark completed items, add discovered items, update in-progress items. Do not do any other work.
```

**Rules:**

- The sync agent should be the ONLY agent that writes to `developer_checklist.yaml` — all other agents use `TEMPO_STATUS` blocks.
- Discovered items should be appended to the appropriate phase with the next available ID.
- If a phase referenced by a discovered item does not exist, create it.
- The sync agent should log each update it makes (e.g., "Marked 2.1 as done", "Added new item 3.4: Handle edge case X").
